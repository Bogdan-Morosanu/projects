# let us start by calculating all squares of ints in 1..10
# we will be using the wildcard '_' character 
# it captures the result of the last expression evaluated
# this will be our data array and we shall pass it
# to our square generating polynomial
square = [ 0 0 1 ] # square generating polynomial
1 to 10 # our data array
square( _ ) # and squares pop out!
