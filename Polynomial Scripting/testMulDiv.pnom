# let us now test division and multiplication

poli1 = [ 0 1 ] 
poli2 = [ 1 1 ]
#poli1 * poli2
#toDivide = _ 		# since our expressions are strictly binary, we must capture
			# result via chaining
#toDivide / poli1
#_ - poli2 		  # notice result is 0, our division result is equal to p2

#toDivide % p2     # notice result is 0, p2 divides its product with p1
